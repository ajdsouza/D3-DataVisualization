1. Graph Layout with Linear Scaled Node Size based on Goals Scored
2. Graph Layout with Square Root Scaled Nodes based on Goals Scored


Both scales show 2 clusters, with nodes Kelsey,Jack and MCcullough,Bill connecting them. 
The goals square root shows a less cluttered plot, with a clearer presentation of the clusters.
Goal range 0-174, for fixed scale even small goal numbers are visibe in root sqrt compared to the linear plot.
